# Calorie Tracker
This application was built by Anthony Jimenez and I for our Web Development II final project. We aimed to build our project with the React framework and MongoDB for our database to prove to ourselves that we could implement technologies we had not yet learned in class. Calorie Tracker calculates the Body Mass Index of a user based on their weight, height, and age input. Based on the result we reccomend a daily calorie count. A user can also input calorie events that reduce or increase the dsily calorie count based on the calorie event type. If you'd like to start keeping track of your daily calorie intake then Calorie Tracker is the application for you!
